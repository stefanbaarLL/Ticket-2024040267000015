Test:
When these deleted submodules are updated upstream, a (command line) git
rebase triggers a merge conflict for these deleted submodules.

What I just discovered is that this "updated" Smartgit version does not
allow me to right-click these submodule and resolve the problem by Removing
the submodule, because the menu option was disabled, I had to use the
command line to remove the submodule.
